                    <h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hello you're welcome to my portfolio site hello on this page are a number of sites and files
                        from projects I worked on while at Clark Community College in Vancouver Washington. these
                        are
                        projects that I struggled with but in the end, I became incredibly proud of them. My hope is
                        that you can go through some or all of these and get a holistic vision of the kind of work I
                        want to put forward into the world.
                    </p>

                    <p class="col flex-column ">
                        The first piece is an SQL database I worked on. for this project, we were given the basic
                        database and a simple frame of a website to modify and make much more useful.
                        Specifically, we had to integrate a way to add and remove information from the database and
                        have
                        it displayed in real-time. As well as add the Functionality to sort and search the database
                        in a
                        convenient and efficient manner. The visibility and readability of the site were also left
                        to
                        our discretion to make it more user-friendly.

                        alt="Image Description">
                    <p>

                        This site was made in the same class as the above and which we were to put together a full
                        blog.
                        site is made entirely with PHP. and I must say I'm incredibly proud of it. this project was
                        frustrating at times because functionality was my biggest enemy. Weather in the end I
                        managed to
                        put together something I'm incredibly proud of and though it is not live on the internet and
                        just uses a bunch of D&D loeum Ipsum I'm still happy with the way it looks and the way it
                        works.

                        And this last site here is a very unique project for me this was made in a separate class in
                        the
                        same spring of 2023 in which I and a group of four others were put in charge of revitalizing
                        the
                        Clark College adjunct faculty portal. We were treated as a team of Freelancers hired to do a
                        job
                        for a site that was built the year prior and now needed some new functionality.
                        and this project I took the role of the project manager I worked directly with our account
                        manager and the clients themselves to relay their desires to the rest of our team so that we
                        can
                        make them real. I had a wonderful team and we were able to deliver our promise to revitalize
                        this site in the ways our clients wanted
