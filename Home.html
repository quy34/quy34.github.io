                    Hi again
                </h3>
                <main>
                    <p>if you clicked on this site's second page, I want to thank you. And unless you're here by
                        random accident it's safe to assume that we all know what a portfolio site is for. I'm here to
                        sell myself, a task I've never enjoyed but I'm told is very important.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I find this task difficult because I'm still very much learning, literally still enrolled at
                        Clark College as I write this. Throughout the many drafts of this page I have written both in
                        word and in my head. I've come to realize that selling myself as something I'm not is a waste of
                        my time and it's a waste to anyone reading this.
                        So it's at this point I'll give the warning that if you don't like long-winded tangents and And
                        tortured metaphors you may want to move on to the experience Tab and hopefully something there
                        will pick your interest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At the time of writing, I've come to realize that a very similar level of skill and experience
                        with web development as I do with steel fabrication. Steel Fab is the career my father has
                        mastered. And it's through his teaching as well as an excellent shop teacher in high school as
                        well as a few odd jobs that I've come to a moderate amount of skill. I can lay a bead, clean it
                        up with a grinder, cut the pieces to be square and flush, and All That Jazz.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So in comparison to my father, I cannot sell myself the way he can. With confidence, my father
                        can say “if you give me enough cash I can make you any solid structure out of steel” and he has
                        40 years to back that up.
                        What I'm doing is telling the shop foreman that I can lay a bead, wear my safety glasses and
                        steel toes, and, Show up on time.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's exactly what I'm telling you. I can put together a site with PHP, HTML and make it look
                        pretty all right with CSS I know my way around an SQL database and Word press and what I don't
                        know I know how to research, troubleshoot, and find Solutions,
